About Us
</h3>

 <p align="center"> Children are abused all around the world and many of them are too worried to actually say something about it. So, we're here today and <b>every</b> day, to listen to and repair the heartbreak of our future adults. (Children. Our Future Adults which will lead to Future generations are being put against their own will and being abused in all sorts of undreamable ways.)

What is Child abuse?
</h3>

<p align="center">
Child abuse can be defined as violence against children or maltreatment of children.

There are four main types of violence against children:

Physical abuse
Sexual abuse
Mental abuse
Neglect
These could include maltreatment or exploitation, harm or abuse, including commercial sexual exploitation, trafficking, child labour and harmful practices, such as female genital mutilation/cutting and child marriage.

Child abuse can happen anywhere – from here in Australia, with the Royal Commission into child abuse, to developing countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Child abuse is a larger problem than we realise. It affects at least 1.7 billion children every year, but the numbers could be much larger due to underreporting.

For these children, the effects of child abuse can last for life.

What are the effects of child abuse?
</h3>

<p align="center">
Child abuse can have long-term consequences, often causing stress that is associated with disruption in early brain development. Extreme stress can impair the development of the nervous and immune systems.

Adults who have been abused as children are at an increased risk of behavioural, physical and mental health problems. Signs of child abuse could include:

-depression
-smoking
-perpetrating or being a victim of violence
-obesity
-high-risk sexual behaviours
-unintended pregnancy
-alcohol and drug misuse

These behaviours and characteristics can contribute to heart disease, cancer, suicide and sexually-transmitted infections.

Child abuse also has an economic impact, which could include costs of hospital stays, mental health treatment, child welfare, and longer-term health costs.

Facts and Statistics
</h3>

<p align="center">
-Children make up more than a quarter (28 percent) of all detected trafficking victims. 
-Nearly 50 million children, across the globe, have migrated across or within borders, or been forcibly displaced. More than half that number – 28 million – are boys and girls who have fled violence and insecurity. 
-One quarter of all adults report having been physically abused as children.
-International studies suggest one in five women and one in 13 men report having been sexually abused as a child.
-Every year, there are an estimated 41,000 children under 15 years of age who die from homicide. This number may not represent the whole problem, as a large proportion of deaths due to child abuse are incorrectly attributed to falls, burns, drowning and other causes.
