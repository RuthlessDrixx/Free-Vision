About Us
</h3>

 <p align="center"> Children are abused all around the world and many of them are too worried to actually say something about it. So, we're here today and <b>every</b> day, to listen to and repair the heartbreak of our future adults. (Children. Our Future Adults which will lead to Future generations are being put against their own will and being abused in all sorts of undreamable ways.)

What is Child abuse?
</h3>

<p align="center">
Child abuse can be defined as violence against children or maltreatment of children.

There are four main types of violence against children:

Physical abuse
Sexual abuse
Mental abuse
Neglect
These could include maltreatment or exploitation, harm or abuse, including commercial sexual exploitation, trafficking, child labour and harmful practices, such as female genital mutilation/cutting and child marriage.

Child abuse can happen anywhere â€“ from here in Australia, with the Royal Commission into child abuse, to developing countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Child abuse is a larger problem than we realise. It affects at least 1.7 billion children every year, but the numbers could be much larger due to underreporting.

For these children, the effects of child abuse can last for life.
