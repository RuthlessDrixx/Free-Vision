What is Child abuse?
</h3>

<p align="left">
Child abuse can be defined as violence against children or mistreatment of children. There are four main types of violence against children:

<ul>
<li>Physical abuse
<li>Mental abuse
<li>Sexual abuse
<li>And Neglect
<p>    

<p>
These could involve mistreatment or oppression, torment or abuse, such-as sexual slavery, human trafficking, child labour and hurtful practices, such as breast ironing and forced early marriage.</p>

<p>Child Abuse can occur no matter the amount of security and welfare and can happen anywhere. Such as here in Australia with the Royal Commission onto child abuse, to evolving countries like Benin in West Africa.</p>

<p>Child Abuse is a much greater conflict than most people suspect. It affects at least 1.7 billion minors every year, although the numbers could be even greater due to underreporting.</p>

<p>Children who suffered from abuse as a minor can have effects on them which last for life.</p>

What are the effects of child abuse?
</h3>

<p align="left">
Impacts and effects of child abuse can have many consequences for short and long amounts of time. A main impact is stress which disrupts early brain development. In worse cases, extreme stress may occur, which can damage the development of the nervous and immune systems.</p>

<p>Long term effects can last for life, increasing the risk of behavioural, physical and mental health problems of adults who were abused as children. Signs of child abuse could include:

<ul>
<li>depression
<li>smoking
<li>perpetrating or being a victim of violence
<li>obesity
<li>high-risk sexual behaviours
<li>unintended pregnancy
<li>alcohol and drug misuse
<p>    

<p>
Heart disease, cancer, suicide and sexually-transmitted infections are all contributed by these behaviours and attributes.</p>

<p>Child abuse also has an economic impact, which could include costs of hospital stays, mental health treatment, child welfare, and longer-term health costs.</p>

Facts and Statistics
</h3>

<ul align="left">
<li>Children make up more than a quarter (28 percent) of all detected trafficking victims. 
<li>Nearly 50 million children, across the globe, have migrated across or within borders, or been forcibly displaced. More than half that number – 28 million – are boys and girls who have fled violence and insecurity. 
<li>One quarter of all adults report having been physically abused as children.
<li>International studies suggest one in five women and one in 13 men report having been sexually abused as a child.
<li>Every year, there are an estimated 41,000 children under 15 years of age who die from homicide. This number may not represent the whole problem, as a large proportion of deaths due to child abuse are incorrectly attributed to falls, burns, drowning and other causes.
