About Us
</h3>

<p align="left">
1.7 billion minors and possibly <b>much more</b> are affected by child abuse every year. This is unacceptable and something has to be done about it. Which is why we're here. Free Vision protects millions of children of all races, cultures and ages from 0 to 17.


<p>Here at Free Vision, we supply aid and recources for millions of children from all around the world. We provide counselling, shelter, food, clothing, mentoring and safe families willing to look after these vulnerable minors.

<p><b>Why do we exist?</b>
Believe it or not, we have been asked this question more than once, so we may aswell answer it:

<ul>
<li> To make this world a better place.
<li> To put a stop to child abuse.
<li> To decrease the amount of mistreatment such as sexual slavery, human trafficking and child labour and then eventually put a stop to it all over.
<li> And most importantly... To give vulnerable young and youth a secure and safer place to live and call home.

What is Child abuse?
</h3>

<p align="left">
Child abuse can be defined as violence against children or mistreatment of children. There are four main types of violence against children:

<ul>
<li>Physical abuse
<li>Mental abuse
<li>Sexual abuse
<li>And Neglect
<p>    

<p>
These could involve mistreatment or oppression, torment or abuse, such-as sexual slavery, human trafficking, child labour and hurtful practices, such as breast ironing and forced early marriage.</p>

<p>Child Abuse can occur no matter the amount of security and welfare and can happen anywhere. Such as here in Australia with the Royal Commission onto child abuse, to evolving countries like Benin in West Africa.</p>

<p>Child Abuse is a much greater conflict than most people suspect. It affects at least 1.7 billion minors every year, although the numbers could be even greater due to underreporting.</p>

<p>Children who suffered from abuse as a minor can have effects on them which last for life.</p>

What are the effects of child abuse?
</h3>

<p align="left">
Impacts and effects of child abuse can have many consequences for short and long amounts of time. A main impact is stress which disrupts early brain development. In worse cases, extreme stress may occur, which can damage the development of the nervous and immune systems.</p>

<p>Long term effects can last for life, increasing the risk of behavioural, physical and mental health problems of adults who were abused as children. Signs of child abuse could include:

<ul>
<li>depression
<li>smoking
<li>perpetrating or being a victim of violence
<li>obesity
<li>high-risk sexual behaviours
<li>unintended pregnancy
<li>alcohol and drug misuse
<p>    

<p>
Heart disease, cancer, suicide and sexually-transmitted infections are all contributed by these behaviours and attributes.</p>

<p>Child abuse also has an economic impact, which could include costs of hospital stays, mental health treatment, child welfare, and longer-term health costs.</p>

Oshuri: Learning to open up again
</h3>

<p>Home used to be a terrifying place for 14-year-old Oshuri.

<p>When Oshuri was brought to Free Vision staff, she was in deep distress, and continually said, “I don’t like my father. I don’t like my father.”

<p>Eventually, she shared the awful truth: Her father would physically abuse her almost every day. She lived alone with him since she was six, and she hadn’t gone to school for years.

<p>Staff took Oshuri under their wing. Her father was interrogated and admitted it was all true. In turn, Oshuri was given counselling to help her cope with the abuse she’d faced.

<p>That was three years ago. Today, Oshuri is living with a foster family and hasn’t looked back. With the assistance of Free Vision, she is finally getting a steady education, and counselling has helped her blossom in confidence.

<p>“It is quite difficult for us to build her up because she’s been through a lot,” said Joyani, Oshuri’s foster mother. “But I still do my best to teach her and bring her up in the best possible way.”

<p>For Oshuri, now home is a safe place – a place where she has an opportunity to be loved, cared for and nurtured. It’s what every child deserves.

Facts and Statistics
</h3>

<ul align="left">
<li>Children make up more than a quarter (28 percent) of all detected trafficking victims. 
<li>Nearly 50 million children, across the globe, have migrated across or within borders, or been forcibly displaced. More than half that number – 28 million – are boys and girls who have fled violence and insecurity. 
<li>One quarter of all adults report having been physically abused as children.
<li>International studies suggest one in five women and one in 13 men report having been sexually abused as a child.
<li>Every year, there are an estimated 41,000 children under 15 years of age who die from homicide. This number may not represent the whole problem, as a large proportion of deaths due to child abuse are incorrectly attributed to falls, burns, drowning and other causes.
<li>Globally in 2014, 1 billion children aged 2–17 years experienced physical, sexual, emotional or multiple types of violence.
<li>A quarter of all adults report having been physically abused as children.
<li>One in five women and one in 13 men report having been sexually abused as a child.
<li>In 2014, children comprised 28 percent of detected trafficking victims.
<li>Every year, there are an estimated 41,000 homicide deaths in children under 15 years of age.
<li>US$7 trillion is lost due to violence against children each year equivalent to 8 percent of global GDP.
